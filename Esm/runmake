## runmake
## -----------
## Perform a full build
## This is used by the weeklybuild script to provide product specific
## build operations for product's whose build is more complex
## than simply a "make stage prepfiles"
## When this is invoked, the current directory will be the TL_DIR for a
## full checkout of the product to be built
##
## Usage:
##	runmake [-B 'build_config'] [-n]
##			or
##	runmake -r [-B 'build_config'] [-iCR] [-n]
##
## Arguments:
##	-B build_config	release type to build, (debug/release). default is release
##	-r		rerun the build in place without doing a new checkout/tag
##	-i		allow incremental builds by building in-place before package rpm
##	-R		skip building rpm, just leave in-place files
##	-C		don't clobber prior to the rerun
##	-n		No build.  Useful for checking build machine
##
## In addition, the following environment variables are expected to be set:
##	RELEASE_TAG, BRANCH_TAG, BUILD_TARGET, PRODUCT, RELEASE_HOME, BUILD_CONFIG 
##	The target command is expected to have already been run to set up the
##	environment for the specified target
##
##	re-run can be used for 2 situations:
##	1. re-run a failed build to correct incorrect weeklybuild arguments
##		or other non-source code related problems (out of disk space)
##	2. re-run a build for a different BUILD_TARGET_OS_VERSION while using the same
##		source code image/tag
##	If the source code needs to be corrected, a full weeklybuild should be run
##	after the correction such that the code is properly tagged.
##
## For developer builds (such as via dobuildall), the following combinations
## of the -r, -i, -C and -R options are useful
##	-r	- existing typical mode for developer builds
##			- clobbers any existing built files
##			- creates a src.rpm
##			- builds in rpmbuild tree
##			- creates a resulting binary rpm
##	-r -C - behaves same as -r above except skips the clobber
##	-r -i [-C] - incremental build mode for developer builds
##			- clobbers any existing built files (unless -C specified)
##			- builds code in place in source tree
##			- src rpm contains pre-built code
##			- rpmbuild ends up using pre-built code, creates binary rpm
##			After this build, the developer may do incremental sub-tree builds
##			using . setenv and then running make in the subtree
##	-r -i [-C] -R - incremental build mode for developer builds with no rpms
##			- same as -r -i [-C] except no rpms are created
##	none of these options - typical production build
##			- expects a fresh un-built checkout of code tree
##			- creates a src.rpm
##			- builds in rpmbuild tree
##			- creates a resulting binary rpm
##
## Recommended developer sequence of builds when debugging new code
## -r -i -C -R - performs the fastest full build possible, generates no rpms
##			It is recommended to omit the -C option on 1st build so the tree
##			is clobbered to be sure you start fresh.
##			iterate on this and code changes until the basic build works
##			and syntax errors and warnings are all resolved
##			For unit tests only needing a few binaries, they can also be
##			directly tested.
##			after initial attempt, if compile errors are limited to a subtree:
##				create a new bash shell, use . setenv and then
##				iterate on make in the subtree and code changes until compiles
## -r -i -C - performs a build to generate rpms
##			install the rpms and continue testing
##			if focused on a few executables:
##				create a new bash shell, use . setenv and then
##				iterate on make in the subtree and code changes and test of
##				the individual binary until works properly
## -r		- perform a full build and generate rpms
##			install the rpms, confirm clean build, proper install and function
##
##	Since weeklybuild and target commands always set BUILD_CONFIG, this
##	script ignores BUILD_CONFIG.  As such the BuildOptions file
##	or the -B argument completely control BUILD_CONFIG for this product.
